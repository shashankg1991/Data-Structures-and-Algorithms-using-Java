     * Character in java is 16 bits and was designed to store the values all the unicode
     * characters present at that time. However, the number of characters increased > 2^16.
     * To tackle this, java created a functionality that a character can be denoted by a
     * single character or by 2 characters in combination.
     * 
     * codePointAt method gives the value of character as integer.
     * The character can have 2 parts, lower surrogate and a higher surrogate
     * each of them is a character.
     * Both have individual ranges. Java checks if the first part has value in 
     * range of lower surrogate and 2nd part has value in range of higher surrogate then
     * it combines them and gives the integer value when requested bu codePointAt otherwise
     * the value of individual character is returned.
     * 
     * charCount checks on the basis of integer value if this value is denoted by single character
     * or by 2 characters
     * 
     * toChars converts the character int value to proper character for display.
