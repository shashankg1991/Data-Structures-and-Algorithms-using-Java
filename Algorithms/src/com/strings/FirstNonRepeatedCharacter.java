/**
 * Character in java is 16 bits and was designed to store the values all the
 * unicode characters present at that time. However, the number of characters
 * increased > 2^16. To tackle this, java created a functionality that a
 * character can be denoted by a single character or by 2 characters in
 * combination.
 * 
 * codePointAt method gives the value of character as integer. The character can
 * have 2 parts, lower surrogate and a higher surrogate each of them is a
 * character. Both have individual ranges. Java checks if the first part has
 * value in range of lower surrogate and 2nd part has value in range of higher
 * surrogate then it combines them and gives the integer value when requested bu
 * codePointAt otherwise the value of individual character is returned.
 * 
 * charCount checks on the basis of integer value if this value is denoted by
 * single character or by 2 characters
 * 
 * toChars converts the character int value to proper character for display.
 * 
 * Complexity : O(n)
